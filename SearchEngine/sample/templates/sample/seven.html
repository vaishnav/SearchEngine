    <p>An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself,[1] typically to be used by end-users. Examples of an application include a word processor and a media player. The collective noun refers to all applications collectively.[2] The other principal classifications of software are system software, relating to the operation of the computer, and utility software ("utilities").

        Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately and may be coded as proprietary, open-source, or projects.[3] Apps built for mobile platforms are called mobile apps. </p>
